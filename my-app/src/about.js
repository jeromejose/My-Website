            <body>
                I am currently a University of Auckland student studying Computer Systems Engineering who is passionate for software
                development especially in the back end. When I have the time, I like to play MMORPGs prominently Destiny and Genshin Impact, 
                I also enjoy creating the odd personal project like this one that culminates usefulness and demonstration of programming skills.
