                Welcome to my home page! This website is a personal project with the purpose of demonstrating my REACT skills as 
                well as a formal introduction of my former self. I have benefitted greatly from this project as exposure to REACT 
                has made me appreciate how useful components are when building websites like this one. Although I can argue that setting
                up REACT is somewhat tedious with having certain dependencies needed to be installed to use features like Route and Link
                but with the internet, this information was easily obtainable and I consider this as just a minor nit pick.
